# Python Mini Projects ‚Äì Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code

This repository contains Python mini projects I‚Äôve built while following [Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

## üìò About the Course

Angela Yu's course is a comprehensive, beginner-friendly Python bootcamp designed to take you from the basics to advanced programming concepts through hands-on coding challenges. The course covers topics including data types, control flow, functions, object-oriented programming, web scraping, automation, and GUI application development.  

This repository captures my progress during the initial phase of the course, focusing on fundamental Python concepts and practical mini projects.
