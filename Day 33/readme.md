# Day 33 – Environment Setup

To run **ISS Overhead**, create a `.env` file [here](../Day%2033/) with the following content:

```env
EMAIL_USER=youremail@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password_or_app_password
EMAIL_RECIPIENT=recipient@example.com
```

> ⚠️ Do **not** commit the `.env` file. Ensure it's listed in `.gitignore`.
