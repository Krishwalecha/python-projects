# Day 38 – Environment Setup

To run **Exercise Tracker**, create a `.env` file [here](../Day%2038/) with the following content:

```env
APP_ID=your_nutritionix_app_id
API_KEY=your_nutritionix_api_key
```

> ⚠️ Do **not** commit the `.env` file. Ensure it's listed in `.gitignore`.
For setting up your own sheet, refer to the [Sheety API documentation](https://sheety.co/docs/requests).
