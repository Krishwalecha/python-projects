# Day 47 – Environment Setup

To run **Amazon Price Tracker**, create a `.env` file [here](../Day%2047/) with the following content:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your_email_address@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password_or_email_password
EMAIL_RECIPIENT=recipient_email@example.com
```

> ⚠️ Use [App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) if you're using Gmail with 2FA.  
> ⚠️ Do **not** commit the `.env` file. Ensure it's listed in `.gitignore.
